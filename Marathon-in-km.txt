The marathon is a long-distance foot race with a distance of 42 km 195 m (c. 26 mi 385 yd), usually run as a road race, but the distance can be covered on trail routes. 
The marathon can be completed by running or with a run/walk strategy. There are also wheelchair divisions. 
More than 800 marathons are held worldwide each year, with the vast majority of competitors being recreational athletes, as larger marathons can have tens of thousands of participants.[2]
